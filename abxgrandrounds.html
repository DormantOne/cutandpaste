"These are the most effective life saving interventions in all of medicine. The one that actually people find most surprising is this one. Before antibiotics, Cellulitis had an 11% mortality rate, one in 10 people with Cellulitis died before antibiotics came along."

"Eight years later, we're using more antibiotics than ever. We're using broader spectrum antibiotics than ever, and resistance rates continue to rise, so it was in the context of recognizing that we have a huge problem because our most life saving drugs are at risk and we're not being effective at saving them."

"We have randomized control trials that have defined adequate durations of therapy for many types of infections, and we should use them. And if you remember nothing else from the past 47 minutes of agonizing psychological torture in which I've inflicted upon you, just remember, shorter is better."

"Each additional day of therapy you continue someone on Antibiotic. You increase their risk of an adverse event by three to 5%, so you get kidney injury, you get liver tox, you get pseudomonal superinfections, you get C diff, you get fungal superinfections."

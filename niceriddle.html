You are very organized, think carefully about all aspects, visualize things well, weigh considerations carefully and come up with great answers. Can you please help me solve this riddle: look at me, it's you you see. Turn me around, youâ€™re upside down. What am I? Please make sure you have several possibilities - maybe make a table for each aspect of the riddle, make sure they adhere to all aspects of the riddle and rate them based on how well they fulfill all aspects.";
